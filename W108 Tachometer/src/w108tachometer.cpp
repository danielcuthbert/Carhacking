The pulse variable is a 16-bit int and the 8-bit processor wonâ€™t be able to read in a single CPU cycle.
That in itself is not an issue, until interrupts come into the picture. So this means there is a possibility 
that the pulse bump interrupt will occur right in the middle of the CPU reading the current value in loop(), 
and we will end up writing/reading half of the previous value, and half the new value.

So to solve this, we use atomic (we hope)
